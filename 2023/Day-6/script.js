// Challenge #6

// The elves are cataloging Santa's reindeer ðŸ¦Œ based on the distance they can travel.

// For this, they have a text string movements where each character represents the direction of the reindeer's movement:

// > = Moves to the right
// < = Moves to the left
// * = Can move forward or backward
// For example, if the movement is >>*<, it goes to the right twice, then it can go either left or right (whichever maximizes the final traveled distance) and then left.

// The elves want to know what the maximum distance the reindeer travels is after completing all movements.

// In the previous example, the maximum distance the reindeer travels is 2. It goes to the right twice +2, then with the * it can go to the right again to maximize the distance +1 and then it goes to the left -1.

// Create a maxDistance function that takes the text string movements and returns the maximum distance that the reindeer can travel in any direction:

function maxDistance(movements) {
    // Initialize our movements and set the count of it
    const directions = {
     "<": 0,
     ">": 0,
     "*": 0
    }
   
    for (const movement of movements) {
     directions[movement] += 1
    }
   
    return Math.abs(directions["<"] - directions[">"]) + directions["*"]
   }
